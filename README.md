# Bug: BlueJ lacks UTF-8 support(?) on Windows

I was adding Unicode to my project and when running it in BlueJ I noticed the characters were mangled, I believe that the issue has to do with BlueJ not using the correct encoding on Windows.

## Observations

**Note**: the following was tested on and does not occur on Linux.

Unicode emoji appearing garbled in BlueJ. (4 hex digits when looking at hex dump)

Observed after pasting `ðŸ˜³` through emoji picker. (1 hex digit when looking at hex dump)

Clearly, on Windows specifically, BlueJ appears to be using the wrong encoding.

## Tests

This series of tests did the following steps:
1. Export a new jar for BlueJ, with the original encoding and source.
2. Export a jar from BlueJ after importing (1.) and then immediately re-exporting it.
   
   This is just a sanity check to ensure that it is a valid BlueJ jar.
3. Edit `App.java` and replace the garbled emoji by pasting `ðŸ˜³` then export the jar.

## Maybe it's Windows? Or just more bugs.

While I was testing this, someone mentioned to me about `chcp 65001`, which in fact led me to discover yet another bug.

> **Disclaimer**: This is probably something to do with the way I'm building the jar... on Linux but not Windows that's causing BlueJ to choke but at the same time that doesn't really make sense since the procedure is the same. Although I do a final test in reverse at the end.

I enabled the [Unicode UTF-8 beta in Windows using this StackOverflow guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57131654/using-utf-8-encoding-chcp-65001-in-command-prompt-windows-powershell-window), which led me to find:

1. Using the Windows exported jar on Windows, I got the same result, with mangled emoji.
2. Using the Linux exported jar ([download bluej_out.jar](https://github.com/insertish/bluej-bug-demo/raw/master/Linux%20Exports/bluej_out.jar)) on Windows caused BlueJ to eternally hang.

   Upon checking the debug log I found this error:

3. Using the BlueJ exported jar from Linux on Windows worked just fine.

### Ok how about doing it in reverse?

This time, I took that existing BlueJ project (from a working copy with mangled characters, i.e. the original but successfully imported), exported it while under this Windows beta mode and then restarted to see what would happen when I imported that project, I didn't expect much and it just worked as intended so I guess it was more just to see how if there would be any issue.
