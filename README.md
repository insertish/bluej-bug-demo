# Bug: BlueJ lacks UTF-8 support(?) on Windows

I was adding Unicode to my project and when running it in BlueJ I noticed the characters were mangled, in fact it was reading each 

## Observations

Unicode emoji appearing garbled in BlueJ. (4 )

Observed after pasting ðŸ˜³ through emoji picker.

Linux .jar export being unpacked on Windows (also hit an unrelated error)

## Maybe it's Windows? Or just more bugs.

While I was testing this, someone mentioned to me about `chcp 65001`, which in fact led me to discover yet another bug.

I enabled the [Unicode UTF-8 beta in Windows using this StackOverflow guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57131654/using-utf-8-encoding-chcp-65001-in-command-prompt-windows-powershell-window), which led me to find:

1. Using the Windows exported jar on Windows, I got the same result, with mangled emoji.
2. Using the Linux exported jar on Windows caused BlueJ to crash eternally hang.
